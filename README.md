# YAL
Yet another language 

## Description

Starts with `Kotlin`'s grammar as base, and adds features from `Python`, `C#` and `Java`'s grammars.
This is just the `front-end` of a three-phases compiler for now.

### Checklist

##### Done
- removed `var`, `val` & `fun` keywords
- added standard `for` loop (on steroids)
- added short-circuiting bool ops (`&` and `|`)
- added multi catch + `try`/`catch`/`finally` 1-liner versions
- added list comprehensions
- added list splicing (using `#` instead of `:` because can conflict with `::` reference operator)
- added null-coalescing/elvis assignment operator `?:=`
- added multiple vararg params (has to be separated by `;` if more than one in a single function declaration)
